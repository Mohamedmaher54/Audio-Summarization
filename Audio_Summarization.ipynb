            " So, right, so early on in my career, I spent a lot of time kind of working on fissions and road maps and ideas and you know some of them ended up not happening at all. I remember us throwing away like large projects or canceling them late on. It still happens to me today. It still happens to people on my team today. Yeah, priorities change and I think that is yeah, market change was lots of reasons for it, but I remember being so frustrated because I think I came straight out of school with this idea that you're given an assignment and then you do it. And there is no like takes these backsees on an assignment. It's like here's the content we need from you. Now produce it and then you're graded on it. That's so wildly different than entering in the workforce and it became really difficult to try and like ratify this idea that I just had to work and produce things with none of it. My mattress in the day, none of it might be used, none of it, or any of it might not go anywhere. And it felt like there's like one mental or colossal waste of time. And it took me a while to get over it, but I don't really appreciate it until I joined this newest team where we have this culture of right to think. And it all of a sudden it made me think about things differently, which is not simply that hey, priorities change. Things shift sometimes we stop work to go on something else and you know that's just part of the game. It's like no, no, the act of what you've produced and the content you created is part of the process on making you better at what you do in the future, going forward, honing your skills. Certainly when it comes to the ideation side of things. And then it became a question of well how do I extend that thinking to like all aspects. And or how do I speed up that learning and neck rowing. And so that's where this culture of right to think comes into play where right more. You might still do the same amount, but like right more, right earlier, right often, right, not with the intention of it needing to be a final product and be willing to scrap it and move on once it's served its purpose. And this idea of right to think kind of ties in nicely to iterative processes and doing by learning, but it's just such a nice framing. And it's something I'm constantly now talking about and going back on it. I think it's something to just call out is like the importance of writing to think and reframing young Jacqueline's mindset around throwaway work because in this model there is no such thing to throwaway work. It's all helping you just hone your skills and get better over time.\n"
